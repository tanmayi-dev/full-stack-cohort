/**
youtube on this codebase - https://codepen.io/100xdevs/pen/oNmaXxK
Requirements - 
In the same codebase as above, you should be able to specify an array of segments (similar to youtube)
The player seekbar should get divided into those segments,
There should be a function (scrollToSegment) that lets the user scroll to the start of that specific segment

First person to make a production worthy and mildly clean looking submission here wins the bounty. This code will also be used in the cohort website.

Attaching screenshot of what I mean by segments (doesn't need to have the photo previews, just a description popup on hover is fine)
